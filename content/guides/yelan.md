## Introduction

### Why Should You Play Yelan?

![chibi](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rSJHC2sQwlEKiW0qmIFZp-Y39I5o8qJ1hqDmdyYucyb6OTQ7bFzBTmB-aLybgc9804gryRbJWUm3NLslkOBHf7bfL6zMUyu7ZHDBLcO2F2s5KilA7RJt3qIDK6GrHwHEx3vyI-ElYm8)

People who enjoy using powerful Elemental Bursts for consistent off-field damage will also enjoy the raw damage numbers Yelan provides to the team. Xingqiu players will likely feel somewhat at home with Yelan, due to their similar playstyles in supporting an auto-attacking on-field DPS. Yelan is gifted with a vast array of team compositions, and together with Xingqiu, she forms a pair as powerful on its own as Xiangling and Bennett. 

In short, Yelan and Xingqiu visit the same hair stylist.

### What is Yelan's role in a team?

Yelan is a Hydro-based off-field DPS, with little field time  required compared to other team roles. While leveling a character to 90 is usually good, it is especially important with Yelan, as she scales with her Max HP, which benefits far more from the extra levels than ATK does. 

When using Yelan on your team, she’ll mainly be dealing momentary on-field damage with her Skill and consistent off-field damage with her Burst. Teams utilizing Yelan will primarily be at least one battery/healer, a Viridescent Venerer-holder/healer, and an on-field DPS. Some teammates fulfill multiple roles, like the Raiden Shogun, who is both an on-field DPS and a powerful battery.

The biggest drawback of Yelan’s presence on your team is her obscene Energy Recharge requirements, requiring **_225% or more_** when not paired with batteries and/or other Hydro units. When her team lowers her energy requirements, she makes up for it by maximizing her personal off-field damage.

### Benefits

![chibi](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/yFTeYF1jvyWMr8w4ckjuRwbeN8O9uVR-lrpysrVRC5uDBIxCaHh8ndyT5-uG98mbzjbCD5mJBwQfHi8DhoNP88M5IMZNCHY1vEPwLnV1IJRzYkW2v8q4PtbVmBWtsY6XDUR4OqZ50Kk)

- Capable of dealing strong, consistent Hydro damage, with an extremely powerful Burst in every rotation. Basically, she has high multipliers.

- Yelan’s best free-to-play weapon options are _extremely_ accessible. No gacha required! 

  - Her 4-star best-in-slot when she’s building tons of Energy Recharge, the Favonius Warbow, satisfies much of her Energy needs so she can run an HP% sands, on top of providing Energy for the entire party. 
  - When her energy requirements are low, even the 3-star Slingshot shows up in the top five viable weapon options, which you can obtain from chests. 

- Yelan scales high with her constellations, more than doubling her damage (+150%) from C0 to C6. The jump from C0 to C2 is also a significant increase in both damage and playability.

- **_Extremely flexible team compositions,_** with her ideal teammate, Xingqiu, being F2P-accessible. Almost **_any team at all_** can work with Yelan and Xingqiu together.

- Does not need highly contested buffs to be viable, as her Skill and Burst do not scale off ATK. She competes with and sometimes surpasses Xingqiu when built similarly even when Xingqiu is stacking ATK buffs.

- Can double as an excellent buffer when using Elegy of the End, combined with the ‘ramping buff’ that her Burst gives to your active character.

- You can have the same useful Hydro application on a Burst for both Spiral Abyss teams with both Yelan and Xingqiu.

### Drawbacks

![chibi](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/wcEihuQA5IFIFbYphSJlFAqY7u33QNiOSe3XiN4Fm3yzVYqfSwM3xYp6WqZfFh-G_MtLJdzRb6qrfH6Ro1N3WPgJP6knLcHqTOyv1OUtlsyGAy1os5MpweYP0D6lW5dxqMiNq8bWiwo)

- While Yelan is a flexible unit on her own, astronomical energy requirements force her to be paired with specific teammates (Raiden and/or Xingqiu, with Viridescent support) in order to show off her _true_ power.

- Yelan does not benefit _at all_ from having an ATK stat or from receiving popular ATK bonuses that are on most teams, leaving them wasted on Yelan. The remaining outside buffs for Yelan are miniscule, mainly consisting of Hydro resistance-shred via Viridescent Venerer, Xingqiu’s constellations, Zhongli’s shield or Kazuha’s DMG% buff. The 4pc Archaic Petra set on a teammate can also be used to enhance Yelan’s damage.

- Burst DPS Yelan is a stale playstyle, especially if you’ve been using Xingqiu all this time.

- You can realistically get by just fine with Xingqiu and not roll for Yelan. As an individual character, Yelan is usually a “side-grade” to Xingqiu, neither objectively better nor worse; they’re balanced between each other based on a narrow range of circumstances. 

  - If you don’t need a second source of off-field Hydro for your other Spiral Abyss team, or have no interest in running the Yelan+Xingqiu core in teams, she’s not going to be very exciting unless you appreciate her aesthetic qualities.

- Yelan cannot provide the same defensive utility or level of Hydro application as Xingqiu. Xingqiu, after constellations, also has a longer-lasting Burst, which is especially important when paired with C4+ Xiangling.

- Yelan’s damage is nearly entirely single-target.

- She will cheat you out of everything you’ve ever loved or owned.

## Character Overview

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3_wk8zp8BwYSHEbY4nqrS2ndcneujSRk0yBEXOcgmr9GacFlpksQuJx1lQE9tJSqiwnM1pBTz3gJCKXBXU0KzgWRXI7NP_3GbyMIABilnkb3gA0waIENf8W0qsMtqr-Jh55lG7b2doA)

Yelan’s playstyle is heavily based on gathering enough energy to deploy her Elemental Burst

1. Deploying her Elemental Burst to deal large amounts of consistent Hydro damage.
2. Casting Yelan’s skill to generate energy with mild enemy-grouping.
3. Weaving single Normal Attacks between actions to maximize the number of dice attacks from Yelan.
4. Swapping to the on-field DPS unit to enhance that unit's damage and take advantage of her Hydro application with reactions.
5. Using her special Aimed Shot, the Breakthrough Barb, as necessary to fill down-time or to apply extra Hydro in a pinch.

Yelan can return to the field after her Skill’s cooldown to generate energy, but it’s important to understand that this should mainly be in cases where the DPS has flexible field time. For example, Hu Tao and Raiden’s duration on the field cannot be interrupted with swapping.

At the end of the day, Yelan exists to deal damage from the background, make an appearance to roll her dice, and retreat back into the shadows while her dice and the on-field DPS do the work.

### **Pure HP Scaling and Why It’s Important**

Yelan sets an interesting precedent in being a character who, except for her Normal Attacks, scales _completely _off HP.  Previously-released characters like Hu Tao, Noelle, and Itto have abilities that convert other stats into ATK.

This has significant benefits _and_ drawbacks. Let me explain. 

#### The Bad

Characters like Itto and Noelle who convert their DEF into bonus ATK are capable of benefiting from common offensive buffs like Pyro Resonance, Bennett’s Elemental Burst, Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers, the 4pc Noblesse Oblige artifact set, and the 4pc Tenacity of the Millelith artifact set. 

Yelan, who does _not_ convert her Max HP into bonus attack – instead scaling _purely_ off her Max HP – **_cannot_** benefit from **_any_** of these buffs. This means that on Yelan teams, these buffs are marginally weaker, since they no longer buff the _whole_ team. To emphasize, this eliminates _most_ possible buff sources, forcing Yelan to rely on resistance-shredding from Viridescent Venerer supports, Zhongli’s shield, 4pc Archaic Petra, and Xingqiu’s second constellation. Aside from that, having battery teammates  reduces Yelan’s energy requirements, and this is an indirect buff to her damage; the fewer stats that have to be invested in Energy Recharge, the more stats are available to invest in HP% and CRIT%. This requires being paired with specific team members – usually Xingqiu.

#### The Good

When a character scales entirely off a stat like HP, any ATK stat is **_irrelevant, including weapons’ Base ATK._** Free-to-Play weapons, including 3-Star options, then, have the ability to overpower 5-Star weapons in rankings. The only thing that matters on weapon choices are the weapon’s main stat and passive effects. 

Additionally, HP% main stats and substats on artifacts are both more common and less contested on characters. In Yelan’s case, _most_ of her artifacts can be HP% main stat without significant sacrifice. This gives artifacts originally perceived as junk a new home. In short, she makes up for the drawbacks of being unaffected by ATK buffs in the form of reduced opportunity cost when it comes to weapon and artifact flexibility.

### Yelan vs Xingqiu - Which is Better?

The comparison between Yelan and Xingqiu is easy to make; they have similar Bursts, similar cooldowns, and similar energy generation in the same element. There are, however, some important differences. 

Xingqiu has the ability to apply extra Hydro at close range due to his Rain Sword orbitals. Yelan cannot provide the same amount of Hydro that Xingqiu does, and thus Yelan alone is not sufficient to consistently (and/or comfortably) facilitate Hu Tao’s Vaporize reactions for the average player. C2 on Yelan can help, but it might still not be enough, and it’s unreasonable to expect the average player to have constellations on a limited 5-star unit.

Yelan also does not offer damage reduction, any amount of healing, _or _interruption resistance like Xingqiu does. These are mostly valuable assets, especially interruption resistance for some characters. With that said, Xingqiu and Yelan simply have different goals on a team. In exchange for these utilities, she focuses on raw damage and offensive utility. However, in a vacuum, factoring in personal damage only and similar builds, C0 Yelan’s damage with Aqua Simulacra is only barely more than C6 Xingqiu with Jade Cutter. Factoring in her fourth ascension passive breaks this tie.

**_“Yelan vs Xingqiu” is fundamentally the wrong way to look at this._**

If you’re trying to make Yelan a second Xingqiu, Xingqiu is just the better “Xingqiu.” When in total isolation from each other, Yelan might even come off as underwhelming sometimes.

Instead, Yelan should be viewed as Xingqiu _synergy,_ since pairing them together on a team adds so much extra damage potential for _both_ of them by reducing _each_ of their energy requirements. In these cases, both characters can put full focus on what they’re designed for: Xingqiu for utility and Yelan for damage. It is here where a truly “broken” combo emerges.

Xingqiu and Yelan make a pair surprisingly similar in effectiveness to Bennett and Xiangling: Bennett is a top-tier support and can help satisfy Xiangling’s enormous energy needs in order to bring incredible damage to the team. Xingqiu, likewise, can also battery Yelan while using his Burst in tandem with hers for maximum ranged single-target damage. Both Pyro and Hydro pairs prefer a Viridescent Venerer holder or Zhongli, depending on which on-field DPS takes the fourth team slot. 

These three-member team cores are often good enough _as just a three-person team,_ meaning you can throw almost anyone into a Bennett+Xiangling or Yelan+Xingqiu team and see good results. You can even run both pairs _together!_


### Energy Recharge Requirements
[**Yelan Mastersheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PsrNEjRTLpTUmLu2SFtz0LYNroCS8k8yQHvCB0dEWxw/edit?usp=sharing)

When establishing Energy Recharge needs for a character, it almost entirely depends on the team composition the character is in, along with how many Skill uses are in a rotation per character, and whether or not they are equipped with a Favonius or Sacrificial weapon. It’s advised to use an [Energy Recharge Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vkmgp5n0bI9pvhUg110Aza3Emb2puLWdeoCgrxDlu4/copy).

For Yelan, there is an enormous range of what her energy requirements can be.

|                                      |          |                                     |          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Solo Hydro, One Skill Per Burst**  |          | **Duo Hydro, One Skill Per Burst**  |          |
| Without Fav/Sac                      | 260-270% | Without Fav/Sac                     | 170-180% |
| Favonius Warbow                      | 210-220% | Favonius Warbow                     | 150-155% |
| Sacrificial Bow                      | 175-185% | Sacrificial Bow                     | 130-140% |
| **Solo Hydro, Two Skills Per Burst** |          | **Duo Hydro, Two Skills Per Burst** |          |
| Without Fav/Sac                      | 175-185% | Without Fav/Sac                     | 130-140% |
| Favonius Warbow                      | 150-160% | Favonius Warbow                     | 115-125% |
| Favonius R3+                         | 135-145% | Favonius R3+                        | 105-115% |
| Sacrificial Bow                      | 135-145% | Sacrificial Bow                     | 105-115% |

Most of the time, you’ll be aiming to maximize Yelan’s personal damage. There are few buffs that teammates can provide, but lowering her energy requirements can improve her damage. 

The best way to reduce energy requirements is by using Yelan with teammates, such as other hydro characters or other characters with uniquely high energy generation, that provide lots of energy for her. With lower energy requirements, more stats can be invested into damage. 

It is _strongly recommend_ including _at least one_ of the following characters in your Yelan teams to serve as a battery: Xingqiu, Raiden, Kokomi, Fischl, or Ayato.

### Active Talents
**_Priority: Burst > Skill > Normal Attacks_**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tm9P87cRbn7ECl3kjDRoOiEGESpJ3DIPxH6FUv7irTycr9ybhaik84wvzc6ekgirHQQCHSGNVp8rA6aGglbyjkO5Ufj7IiIt9o-pvhBqQE1M6OJI8MMZfX9kz4qfTpOUD51zvJaOOYs)

#### Normal Attack - Stealthy Bowshot
Talent Priority: #3 or N/A

##### Normal and Charged Attacks

Yelan’s Normal Attacks perform up to four consecutive strikes, dealing Physical damage based on her ATK. 

After being outside of combat for five seconds, Yelan enters a “Breakthrough” state, in which her next Aimed Shot becomes a “Breakthrough Barb.” Breakthrough Barb shots take 80% less time to cast and deals AoE Hydro damage.

**Yelan Frame Data**

_Recorded in 60 FPS_

| Attack Type       | Number of hits/input | Multiplier at T9 | Execution Frame |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| N1                | 1                    | 74.70%           | 17              |
| N2                | 1                    | 71.70%           | 20              |
| N3                | 1                    | 94.80%           | 39              |
| N4                | 2                    | 59.70% x2        | 74              |
| Charged Attack    | 1-2                  | 210.80%          | 94              |
| Breakthrough Barb | 1 (1U Hydro)         | 20% (HP-scaling) | 19              |

Frankly speaking, Yelan’s Normal Attacks are mediocre because they scale with her ATK. This should only be leveled if you wish to maximize Breakthrough Barb damage, as _that_ scales off of HP.

For those absolutely insistent on using her Normal Attack chains, by themselves, N3D is the way to go unless you have C6. In that case, just do five Normal Attacks during her Mastermind state. See the [Combos](#combos) section for more.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xkGoBUbQQrTwAzwMltzne0CnDzSuLeh4ruVp55f_94CxBUBMan-EF6OJnBOS_GLglKyeWzZkT0B3BFtVCPGVHe3FrSNFxzqx6mQTWVs_CesR_K8BDQ5hbDWQ7rS3LaRAv581oUHoXY4)

#### Elemental Skill - Lingering Lifeline
Talent Priority: \#2

When tapping Yelan’s Skill, she dashes while dealing Hydro damage based on her Max HP to the nearest target. On hold, Yelan sprints at high speeds to entangle enemies, damaging them upon the Skill’s release based on Yelan’s Max HP and pulling enemies together.

Each time an enemy is hit with Yelan’s skill, there is a 34% chance for Yelan to re-enter her Breakthrough state, granting an additional Breakthrough Barb shot. Breakthrough Barb’s damage is barely worth the frames and precision needed to fire it, unless you _need _to spend an extra second on field with Yelan, like gathering particles from her Skill before swapping.

Holding Yelan’s skill is mainly for exploring the overworld, repositioning, or grouping enemies. Tapping is often, but not always, the best option.

**In-Depth Attributes**

_Frames are recorded in 60 FPS_

| **Attributes**    | **Data**        |     | **Attributes**  | **Data**               |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Multiplier (T9)   | 38.44% (Max HP) |     | Particle/cast   | 4                      |
| Execution frames  | 44              |     | Particle/min    | 24 (usually 12)        |
| Max Hold Duration | 3 seconds       |     | Elemental Gauge | 1U Hydro on hit        |
| Cooldown          | 10 seconds      |     | ICD             | Standard (3 hits/2.5s) |

Yelan’s Skill is in an awkward position, having a 10-second cooldown that starts _after_ the damage is inflicted. On one hand, this enables her to generate particles twice per rotation with her Skill, helping her energy needs tremendously. On the other hand, even if you were able to time switch-in’s _perfectly, _the animation time alone would extend the rotation to around 22 seconds. Most players, even skilled ones, do not time swaps perfectly. The longer a rotation is extended, the lower the team’s DPS is likely to be, so this is a substantial disadvantage.There are a few ways to mitigate this disadvantage with her Skill. 

- Equip an R3+ Sacrificial Bow to use her Skill back-to-back.
- Acquire C1 to use her Skill back-to-back.
- Pair Yelan only with other characters that benefit from long rotation times.
- Stack enough Energy Recharge so Yelan can function with one Skill use per rotation.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zRhGDNW5zs9TW8Q7iNLOPjhn_OV4Gbn8grCgM2B67pJFRdYlgSM_2GHWbBaGd1CNaR5tec8TYas0Thv5ECP7FJcp_4LQcgHdCQ12jdtTU9qIkusuEeS1FFSDi07tn5M5ZpperNXu8Qk)

#### Elemental Burst - Depth Clarion Dice
Talent Priority: \#1

Splash your enemies with AoE Hydro damage and create dice that attack in triplets in coordination with Normal Attacks or when her Skill hits opponents for a period of time. 

Yelan’s Burst is her bread-and-butter, and entirely responsible for the comparisons to Xingqiu, as it is almost identical in play style. Depth-Clarion Dice is _the_ reason to use Yelan on any team, and her damage with this Burst (along with Burst-related passives Yelan has) are the reasons to use her along with or instead of Xingqiu.

**In-Depth Attributes**

_Frames are recorded in 60 FPS; single-target only_

| **Attributes**   | **Data**          |     | **Attributes**  | **Multiplier @ T9**      |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | --- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Initial DMG      | 12.42% (Max HP)   |     | C2 4th Hit      | 14.00% (Max HP)          |
| Exquisite Throw  | 8.28% x3 (Max HP) |     | Burst Proc Rate | 1 per second (max)       |
| Execution Frames | 124               |     | Energy Cost     | 70                       |
| Duration         | 15 seconds        |     | Elemental Gauge | 1U Hydro on hit          |
| Cooldown         | 18 seconds        |     | ICD             | 3 hits / **_2 seconds_** |


It is critical to remember that Yelan’s Burst only attacks in coordination with _Normal Attacks _and Yelan’s _Skill_ uses_._ **Charged Attacks do not trigger Dice instances.** Yelan’s Skill triggers for her Burst is on a separate cooldown from Normal Attack triggers, meaning you can sneak some extra Burst waves into her rotations.

Using her Burst _alongside_ Xingqiu’s results in impressive damage that allows room for almost anyone to take remaining team slots. Even in teams where Yelan’s Hydro application is sufficient, the Yelan-Xingqiu pair remains just as powerful and cannot be overstated, especially with Xingqiu’s second constellation that shreds the Hydro Resistance of an opponent.

C2 allows Yelan to act as the single Hydro applicator on most teams by adding a fourth hit to every other instance of her dice attack (assuming good timing of Burst triggers), and solves her biggest issue when being compared to Xingqiu.

### Passive Talents

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IB6o9ZIl4fkmD5TEXNuGxipNLQnkkbdDZSlVRXn4bn-zW9gkha4C39NnU4_Cl0iiHp0pOECFO2CF2NcBwuxonPRL2bawpzUxzIq0idMQGzMYBlsEHg_5_ywHJtjUiRvqeEkbY14xha8)
#### First Ascension Passive - Turn Control
When the party has 1/2/3/4 Elemental Types, Yelan’s Max HP is increased by 6% / 12% / 18% / 30%

Most of the time, people do not use more than two of the same elemental type on a team anyways. Calculations done in this guide assume 18% as the standard buff, considering she wants to be paired with an extra Hydro character.

It makes her numbers bigger, due to her Skill and Burst scaling with her Max HP, but is not worth changing how you build your team.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cJRYIK14D9cVZqX7Ao5XT9EErsxhuFG1r5er2TpmDNMK0QuVbNuTZdQRHLP4nPinNjHT2z5oOxBG5wcbSBJXFqCRer1UCkXqP1TFzrgMJuJrY1nDP_1y2f5Xdid9s8iKGSrz9xajbH4)
#### Fourth Ascension Passive - Adapt With Ease
So long as Exquisite Throw is in play, your own active character deals 1% more damage. This increases by a further 3.5% each second. The maximum increase of damage dealt is 50%. The pre-existing effect will be dispelled if Depth-Clarion Dice is recast during its duration.

This is the sole aspect of Yelan’s kit that focuses on improving her teammates’ damage. This is the “ramping buff,” discussed earlier. To take maximum advantage of this buff, players should try to concentrate most of their damage during the latter half of Yelan’s burst.

However, keep in mind that many buffs, like Viridescent Venerer, will expire _before_ the end of Yelan’s Burst, so timing your rotation placements is crucial.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Glki9aJp7I94FMYZ749B84XEjSfVo0TVPl7CPSdFEUGmolgueg-b1J2eVOeK2N_X74odvJ6YPz2SQQYWFyshaGLSPC8tQX_60bLv7X7yeItT-01bLS6-_2S_y5Nee15VfYQ7NRBMMPA)
#### Utility Passive: Necessary Calculation
Gains 25% more rewards when dispatched on a Liyue expedition for 20 hours.

This passive is the very same as Shenhe’s passive, so now every time you send party members out on an expedition, Yelan and Shenhe can go on 20-hour dates through Liyue as they efficiently farm for you.

### Combos
The notation we’ll be using to describe pieces of the combo will go as such:

| **Notation** | **Translation**                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |

#### The Default Off-Field Combo


There isn’t much variety to Yelan’s playstyle. The optimal, but most complex combo is:

**Q > N1 > E > N1 > CA > swap … \[> swap in > E > swap out (optional)]**

Yelan’s playstyle is simple. Use her Burst and Skill in order based on energy needs, weave Normal Attacks between actions, then swap out for your DPS to do the rest of the work. If you need more energy and have a rotation longer than 20 seconds, Yelan can switch in after her Skill’s 10-second cooldown. **_For a simpler combo, use Q > E > Swap or E > Q > Swap._**

Only use Normal Attacks at C6, and only five of them. If you are aiming to use Yelan’s Normal Attacks, N3D spam works. Reference her name card to remember what’s important.

### Constellations
Rolling for one copy of a 5-star unit is already expensive. My advice is to roll for constellations only based on your financial situation and level of disposable income. **_Yelan does not require constellations to function, and is fine at C0._** However, Yelan benefits _greatly_ from her constellations, especially C1 and C2. By C6, Yelan’s’s overall damage increases from C0 by about 150%, at the small, small cost of _thousands of dollars._

In this guide, the DPS increases assume Yelan as the single Hydro unit, so numbers may change as your team further reduces her energy requirements.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GAsbd-onHYvbXIBNL7bCp6jJf7aPmSRDfUlttRG9ihpejK8DbAkIf3iEOyUqFu5XVLOVxyZmlkGJwzSZoQAqMHcnBlt8MT9t-sfmXVHpMQpozPwAnuL4Y6sZpmNcClpuEJnJGl6rrVw)
#### Constellation 1 - Enter the Plotters
Yelan’s Skill adds 1 additional charge.

**DPS increase from C0: ~25%**

This constellation alone reduces Yelan’s Energy Recharge requirement from 225% as the only Hydro unit to 160%. C1 doubles Yelan’s particle generation from 4-8 when used back-to-back, and completely eliminates the need to extend your rotation or swap back to Yelan mid-rotation for more energy. This solves most of her Energy Recharge issues, much like Yae Miko’s C1 does. As always, lower energy needs means more stat investment for offensive stats.

Due to this massive decrease in Energy Recharge, non-ER% bows become stronger on Yelan, while ER% bows become weaker. 4pc Emblem of Severed Fate remains the optimal artifact set choice. Refer to the linked Mastersheet in this guide for a full rundown on how energy requirements impact the damage potential of weapons and artifacts.

Please be aware, however, that _each charge_ has a 10-second cooldown, meaning using _three_ skills in one rotation will throw off the following rotation. In this sense, if you were casting two E’s in your rotation anyways, _this will not increase your energy generation._

If you are determined to get constellations, C1 is a good stopping point if you merely want to remove her limitations.Lastly, C1’s utility is exceptional in the overworld. This is because the cooldown of the first Skill continues counting even while holding through its second use. It effectively reduces the cooldown to 6 seconds, making this incredible for long-distance movement.

#### Constellation 2 - Taking All Comers
When Yelan’s Burst produces a coordinated attack, once every 1.8 seconds, Yelan’s dice will fire a fourth Hydro attack dealing 14% of Yelan’s Max HP as Hydro damage.

**DPS increase from C1: ~23% \|\| from C0: ~55%**

This constellation is similar to one of Xingqiu’s. However, for Yelan, this fourth (stronger) attack only occurs every _other_ proc of her Burst. Yelan, at C2, applies enough Hydro on her own to catch up with Hu Tao, Klee, Yanfei, and Fischl-Beidou pairs. While Hu Tao’s reactions might stumble once or twice during a rotation even with C2, this is still a massive bonus for minimal downside.

#### Constellation 3 - Beware the Trickster’s Dice
Increases the Level of Yelan’s Burst by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15.

**DPS increase from C2: ~12% \|\| from C0: ~75%**

Hydro Dice pew pew hard. Hydro Dice pew pew harder now.

#### Constellation 4 - Bait-and-Switch
Increases all party members' Max HP by 10% for 25s for every opponent marked by Lifeline when the Lifeline explodes. A maximum increase of 40% Max HP can be attained in this manner.

**DPS increase from C3: ~8% \|\| from C0: ~90%**

This is only a modest damage increase, and Yelan is not often holding her Skill cast in combat. The extra Max HP% bonus is extra nice when paired with other HP-scaling units like Hu Tao, Kokomi, Zhongli, and Ayato. Multiple skill casts will also stack the buffs instead of refreshing, so using C1 to double tap Skill will net 20% HP at the very minimum.  Don’t make this a priority, but don’t sleep on it either!

#### Constellation 5 - Dealer’s Sleight
Increases the level of Yelan’s Skill by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15.

**DPS increase from C4: ~2% \|\| from C0: 93%**

Not much to say here, other than her skill hits harder now. The caveman-speak joke from C3 only works once. _Diminishing returns,_ one might say.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7b2LfCcFdsh7mjltHuSGTEX77F58S6oSYqlBuG3rIfzpCMANr1OBRNrO7UsApuowHKDyeA6xrA1NCB9goAi9c8G6oGU1B9t3d2x4_9Kc46Vr37XeR_53LVk4II9JH4wPinXvlreG10Q)
#### Constellation 6: Winner Takes All
After using Yelan’s Burst, she will enter the Mastermind state.__In this state, all of Yelan's Normal Attacks will be special Breakthrough Barbs. These Breakthrough Barbs will have similar abilities to normal ones and the DMG dealt will be considered Charged Attack DMG, dealing 156% of a normal Breakthrough Barb's DMG.__The Mastermind state lasts 20s and will be cleared after Yelan fires 5 arrows.

**DPS increase from C5: ~31% \|\| from C0: ~150%**

This constellation allows Yelan to take slightly more field-time in order to grant a huge increase to Yelan’s personal damage. If Yelan is the team member who does the most damage and carries your team from the backline (like Xiangling often does), this constellation is worth it. Otherwise, the green numbers above may be somewhat misleading, as this field time eats into the field time of other teammates in the rotation.

It’s unfortunate that this constellation doesn’t allow her to take a full on-field role, but it is a massive power spike nonetheless. Note that you have a full 20 seconds to use up the Breakthrough Barbs, so the five Normal Attacks can be divided across two rotations, if need be. N4’s double-hit uses two Breakthrough Barbs, so a single N4 combo will suffice here.

### Mainstats and Substats

#### Sands: HP% or ER%
The timepiece is the most contested slot, and will depend almost entirely on your team composition and whether or not you have Yelan’s C1. 

When using non-ER% bows in high-ER builds, an ER% sands is almost required, according to KQM’s standards.

At lower energy requirements, however, such as 160% or below, you can safely equip an HP% sands so long as you’re using Emblem of Severed Fate and get enough Energy Recharge substats. 

#### Goblet: Hydro DMG% or HP%
Yelan’s not using her Normal Attacks, so all of her damage is Hydro. When there is an abundance of DMG% Bonus or Yelan is lacking some HP, HP% can cut close to DMG%. 

#### Circlet: Crit Rate%/ Crit DMG% or HP%
As usual Crit is king, but when using any non-Tenacity-based artifact build, HP% circlets only fall 1-2% behind. For CRIT circlet, choose whatever Crit main stat that helps you balance a 1:2 crit ratio, and take substat into consideration as well. Normally the choice depends on the weapon and substats. 

- If you have a Crit Rate% weapon, then usually Crit DMG% is the correct choice 
- If you have a Crit DMG% weapon, then usually Crit Rate% is the correct choice.
- If Yelan’s weapon gives Energy Recharge, then go with whatever will get you to a 1:2 ratio of Crit Rate%:Crit DMG%. Start by aiming for 70CR% : 140CD%. Crit rate is _technically_ stronger, in these cases, but only barely.

Substats priority is as follows:

1. ER% (remember, 160% when paired with Raiden or Xingqiu; 225% otherwise) 
2. Crit DMG%/Crit Rate% 
3. HP%

### The Anatomy of a Yelan Team

A good team consists of characters fulfilling a variety of _roles. _The ideal team for Yelan will typically include an on-field DPS, an appropriate battery, a buffer or debuffer of some kind, and sometimes a shielder or healer. 

**Important Note:** Yelan is a _very_ flexible unit and most team arrangements ‘work.’ The following advice is for those who want to _maximize_ Yelan’ s potential for the average player.

Whenever you’re using a full 4-person team, Yelan’s first team priority is finding an on-field DPS for her to work with. It’s important that characters who take the field can Normal Attack enough to trigger waves of Yelan’s Burst. A comprehensive overview of DPS units and their ideal teammates alongside Yelan will be covered in the next major section.

Once a DPS and/or a battery is decided, you should pick a character who either makes your rotation more consistent or maximizes the damage Yelan and her teammates can do. Yelan can’t benefit from many buffs or debuffs, so shredding Elemental Resistances with either Zhongli’s shield, an Anemo character, or C2 Xingqiu is your main source of damage amplification.

Finally, many teams prefer the implementation of a healer on their teams, or at least someone who can offer _some_ degree of survivability. Many of these healers satisfy two roles, making this decision fairly easy.

All of the recommended healers satisfy at least one other role. Kokomi and Xingqiu fulfill _three_ different roles. Zhongli and Jean are both good at wielding Favonius weapons to help satisfy energy needs.

### Choosing Yelan’s Champion

![chibi](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BPqMD-hRONSgMIoPWiBz-oDVwaY8C5u9QBw31r0DVMfSIt1CWLafKW3M9bXjfMhm7GQAlVHkW2qk2KBQr4fpi9RHlWK4KtZfjtLD-LNyOMY2_ExoSLdQz2W93h-io055zJDnrtOWU6I)
**Raiden** is both an excellent team battery _and_ an excellent on-field DPS, allowing her to fulfill two roles simultaneously in Yelan teams. While in her Burst form, the Raiden Shogun generates flat energy for her party based on her number of attacks and her Energy Recharge stat. She also increases the Burst damage of her teammates based on their energy cost. Yelan’s 70-cost Burst certainly benefits.

**Recommended Teammates for Raiden + Yelan**

<team-cards :characters="['kazuha', 'xingqiu', 'zhongli', 'venti']"></team-cards>

By adding Xingqiu, Yelan’s energy requirements are as low as they can be. Zhongli can make the team stable and consistent with his shield or a Viridescent Venerer-user like Kazuha can push the team to be more offensive.Other options include characters that can take advantage of Raiden’s energy generation to cast powerful Elemental Bursts. Fischl is a solid standalone off-field DPS in her own right while also contributing to energy needs. It’s important to note that Yelan can also keep up Hydro application in [Sunfire teams featuring Jean and Bennett.](https://library.keqingmains.com/evidence/characters/anemo/jean#anemo-aura)

<team-cards :characters="['fischl', 'jean', 'xiangling', 'bennett']"></team-cards>

![chibi](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1jzDc2I_A7VyhgeMiv5rL697El6lZfFf83rx6SoRSsF-QnIQH3R0FZA04_5H2ITAZdAql2RA6h4QUZFXYD3zBx2PX7uM570tOu8-o9cjwQ-hOBt48c76B9ItF36c1v4rRLU_vqfr_0E)
**Hu Tao** is the premier Pyro DPS when looking for high single-target damage. Xingqiu is her favorite teammate and Yelan’s raw firepower sends this team’s damage even higher. Hu Tao gains (at least) one new team from Yelan, including Xingqiu and Xiangling. Note that because Hu Tao can Vaporize with her Normal Attacks, Charged Attacks and Blood Blossoms, this can quickly deplete Hydro auras. Due to Yelan’s internal cooldown, however, Yelan can reset the Hydro aura on an enemy.

**Recommended Teammates for Hu Tao + Yelan + Xingqiu**

<team-cards :characters="['xingqiu', 'kazuha', 'zhongli', 'xiangling']"></team-cards>

**Xingqiu is _highly advised_** for Hu Tao teams. The **Kazuha** and **Zhongli** are reasonable first-choices for shielding or shredding. Kazuha’s Burst can infuse with Hydro for more application. **Xiangling** and Xingqiu together enable a critical mass of Vaporize reactions.

**Sucrose** shares a portion of her Elemental Mastery with the team and uses Viridescent Venerer to maximize Vaporize reactions. Being a catalyst-wielder opens up support options in Prototype Amber and Thrilling Tales. **Fischl** can apply Electro, which then allows Hu Tao to use both Vaporize and Overload reactions (“Overvape”) simultaneously. Additionally, Electro-Charged reactions weaken a Hydro aura, but Overload reactions remove a Pyro aura, allowing the team to stabilize Hydro application on enemies.

<team-cards :characters="['fischl', 'sucrose', 'thoma']"></team-cards>

![chibi](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEhd2xSU9X84WBGld456e7xGLfvr2lUxzEMs-2B3QaeX_CM3gs-x_ebg-dMOWnhHaZCuEET1qUiejYxFkJK3ZkuaeenGO4qhsGE21WiAT6Zs18K68TogNll6y9brBUsB_wIJc-jelOA)
**Sucrose** is a one-woman mixing pot for Elemental reactions. If there is a team that creates a ton of reactions at once, odds are Sucrose is on the team. With Viridescent Venerer, she reduces enemy Hydro resistance for Yelan, while sharing a portion of her Elemental Mastery stat with teammates to buff reaction damage, usually Electro-Charged. 

**Recommended Teammates for Sucrose + Yelan**

<team-cards :characters="['fischl']"></team-cards>

Start with Fischl. You can’t make any meaningful reactions with Sucrose and Yelan alone. When Sucrose is the on-field attacker, stick with Electro-Charged. Fischl generates energy and does respectable, consistent Electro damage.

<team-cards :characters="['yaemiko', 'beidou', 'xingqiu', 'kokomi']"></team-cards>

If you need healing, take Kokomi. If you want to maximize Yelan’s damage on the team, bring Xingqiu. Otherwise, build more Energy Recharge on Yelan and pick an Electro Burst DPS. Yae Miko is most effective in large single-target scenarios like bosses. Beidou is the default choice when you predict Sucrose will be grouping mobs together.

![chibi](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_0G_iEFxoW68sIHqfvd3a9i5h9AAmG1kMM4VP1D8CCRKqS75a_J4XTtyNE4clv55zPx6BlygNMaJ0DqnsTod_QujifXPvGqy9QK8XvdNEKVw2pDSj0A5c2sQlsK_FvrdfdkDalCULg0)
**Yoimiya** is an excellent single-target driver for Yelan, Xingqiu, and other characters with coordinated attacks. Her arrows help guide the ranged coordinated attacks to their target (and also feels extremely satisfying to play). Yoimiya applies Pyro at a slower rate, so as long as you can secure the third and fifth hits in Yoimiya’s Normal Attack chain, Yoimiya will happily benefit from Yelan’s buffs, damage, and Hydro application.

**Recommended Teammates for Yoimiya + Yelan**

<team-cards :characters="['xingqiu', 'kazuha', 'zhongli', 'venti']"></team-cards>

While Yelan functions as the sole Hydro unit, **Xingqiu** is still recommended if not only for their raw power when paired together. Yoimiya, like Hu Tao, might prefer a defensive option, especially **Zhongli**. **Kazuha** is the default option for crowd control, **Bennett** buffs Yoimiya, generates Pyro energy and heals. His buff is wasted on Yelan, sadly. **Thoma** provides Pyro Resonance and can act as a budget Zhongli alternative. **Yunjin** grants significant buffs to Yoimiya’s Normal Attacks, and **Fischl** generates energy while acting as a _third_ character with off-field damages if you like going all-out with multicolored laser beams.

<team-cards :characters="['bennett', 'fischl', 'yunjin', 'thoma']"></team-cards>

![chibi](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ahfTWwvAXaQnXKDRgosbnUwGQqSURBYlmXhCBXKfN2EDsXDLSk5f-sn_KemsopQ-2dg-Slq-cxgsvuPgVwHC4Fu_MxwzonRz-iMzrCkQGygShVSTBItuzTNq6zVq3Jzjd_sQ_ytU5Y0)
**Kokomi**  can equip the 4pc Ocean-Hued Clam artifact set to maximize both her healing and on-field damage potential. Kokomi also functions as a battery, generating a consistent flow of Hydro particles through her Skill. Because her Burst refreshes the duration of her Jellyfish, she can consistently make use of 4Clam. Because Kokomi can satisfy all three team roles simultaneously, she is a solid on-field choice.

**Recommended Teammates for Kokomi + Yelan**

<team-cards :characters="['xingqiu', 'kazuha', 'fischl', 'venti']"></team-cards>

Xingqiu provides energy to both Yelan and Kokomi, and if Kokomi is driving the team, it’s best to allow her to focus on her damage by reducing energy requirements.Anemo characters provide one of the few available buffs for both Yelan and Kokomi. Kazuha is the generic best choice for raw damage. Venti allows unparalleled crowd control and slight energy refund, while Sucrose can provide Elemental Mastery support and, if needed, equip Favonius Codex for energy generation, or even Hakushin Ring for buffing.

<team-cards :characters="['yaemiko', 'sucrose', 'beidou']"></team-cards>

Fischl is an all-around solid Electro character on her own who adds energy and consistently facilitates Electro-Charged reactions. Her energy production allows room for another energy-hungry DPS like Yae Miko for large bosses or Beidou for small hordes.

![chibi](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/tTvzY-03rocyxhDKdmXVa3ShSFrB2ditYMQKS-NLU0x8-TI_3wqKz63_SL0bBuxdRdR9AKLMAYCmWkjkB7SXl62E43H_akJzX08iAHrA21G_GE-bmR9EppWlrwVQIie2UL0I4wRyeBE)
**Diluc** has fallen out of favor since he was first released and hailed as the go-to DPS. With Yelan on the team, her added personal DPS can be a serious asset, whether or not she’s paired with a battery. Diluc’s greatest asset is his exceptionally forgiving gameplay. To maximize Diluc’s reactions, alternate between his Normal Attack and his Skill. This gives Yelan time to apply Hydro.

**Recommended Teammates for Diluc + Yelan**

<team-cards :characters="['xingqiu', 'jean', 'kazuha', 'zhongli']"></team-cards>

**Xingqiu** can be replaced by Yelan without much trouble, but he remains a solid first choice. Jean reduces elemental resistance while providing much-appreciated healing. Kazuha offers excellent team buffs. Zhongli enables comfortable play with his shield.

<team-cards :characters="['bennett', 'fischl', 'sucrose']"></team-cards>

Bennett buffs Diluc, generates Pyro energy, and heals, though his buff is wasted on Yelan. Fischl or Beidou (depending on Energy Recharge levels) can introduce Electro reactions for the team.

![chibi](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qcjuaBQoMm_CMt8OlI-hD7Ag2gkB_fszO2daHCS9E5DvXVGcupy9c_Zt0lFTcSCFNZGwZz7fgNmMCCAxL1IIuRDpgpoUGpIgo56nkFqWVIgxWfOHDSMQpdMp9nfDcCgcyNyQt2wa71A)
**Ayato** doubles as an on-field DPS and a source of Hydro particles with his Skill. As a bonus, his partial HP scaling appreciates Yelan’s teamwide Max HP buff at C4.In a 24-second rotation where Ayato and Yelan each use their Skills twice a round, this is one of the teams with the lowest energy needs. In single skill-use, shorter rotations, energy needs are much higher and one can benefit from an extra battery.

**Recommended Teammates for Ayato + Yelan**

<team-cards :characters="['fischl', 'jean', 'kazuha', 'venti', 'zhongli']"></team-cards>

Taser teams involving Ayato involve at least one Hydro, Electro, and Anemo character. **Fischl** is a huge boon for both Electro application and managing Ayato _and_ Yelan’s energy requirements. Double Hydro allows even lower ER requirements across the board. Each Anemo unit listed brings something unique to the table while shredding Elemental resistance. **Jean** provides healing, filling the last team slot nicely.  **Kazuha** is the generic best choice for raw damage, **Venti** has unparalleled crowd control, and **Sucrose** can wield Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers or Prototype Amber.If you cannot or will not use any of the previously mentioned choices, **Xingqiu** offers energy, interruption resistance, damage reduction, and shreds enemy Hydro resistance. **Kokomi** is a healer that can use Tenacity of the Millelith and Thrilling Tales to buff and heal. **Yae Miko** and **Beidou**, when energy requirements are met, are potent off-field DPS’s.

<team-cards :characters="['yaemiko', 'beidou', 'kokomi', 'xingqiu', 'sucrose']"></team-cards>

![chibi](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XVFYbr92g-R5j4ilvCAMx9pFmlZsqhWUNAEB0uUQoLG2mQTtCQyUe2rK7jCzawByZ8jlnsYaE4MMXVRpgR1YmQ2y_EFnJMk83G7WAEySLQKVjpo_oLKwbxsDJO9_0zb9GLq2jce5BVg)

**Bennett** was saved for the end of the guide, because everyone is sick of hearing how good Bennett is in every guide, but yes, he really is **_that good,_** even when his buff doesn’t affect Yelan at all. Here, you use Bennett as the on-field DPS, rather than purely a backline support. Grab your 4pc Crimson Witch pieces!

**Recommended Teammates for Bennett + Yelan**

<team-cards :characters="['xingqiu', 'xiangling', 'kazuha', 'chongyun']"></team-cards>

**Xingqiu** can be replaced by Yelan without much trouble, but Xingqiu and Yelan remain as powerful together in Hydro as Bennett and Xiangling are in Pyro.

**Xiangling**, if Bennett is C6, can get away with taking the on-field DPS role due to Bennett’s C6 Pyro infusion. Whether you have Bennett at C6 or not, he batteries Xiangling’s incredibly powerful Burst, which deals heavy damage and has no internal cooldown on its Pyro application, enabling the team to Vaporize and Reverse Vaporize constantly between Yelan and Xingqiu’s combined Hydro application.

Some National team variants sacrifice one of the core three teammates for a Viridescent Venerer-holder like **Kazuha.** In other cases, people opt for a character to help Bennett create Melt reactions while Bennett’s on-field, like **Chongyun.** However, you would need to sacrifice either Xiangling or Xingqiu’s position, depending on your pick.

On one hand, you lose valuable Hydro application and energy generation that the team needs by trading Xingqiu for Kazuha’s resistance shred and damage bonuses. On the other hand, you sacrifice Xiangling’s incredible Burst damage for Chongyun’s Cryo application.

You **_could_** use other characters, but why bother when the best teammates are free (or have been for events)? Any substitution would likely be worse than just running Bennett, Xingqiu, and Xiangling together in the “National” team composition, with almost any DPS thrown into the mix. If you have these three on the same team and invest properly, you basically win the game. Yelan is just one of many other options for National’s fourth slot.

### Other Teammate Details

![chibi](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JaIzCzHpoTQL46ZVOKQ5wWKWeXPvapYQWPAQkp6jJtQ-AmlbqH7yharUZpCV1rFf_KvIiJ0U6SFHJAPoW4__fdp3JgfLdw-j2cSBB6qsYhG6RSL8_Utxxvwb_KHOrYjc-g3lof4qXLA)
**Xingqiu** may seem like a redundant choice, but Xingqiu is the most effective battery for her, especially when wielding an R3+ Sacrificial Sword.

C2 reduces Hydro resistance, a rare buff for Yelan, and covers most of her weaknesses in utility. A flexible unit for all sorts of reaction-based teams.

Yelan and Xingqiu, together, deal such tremendous amounts of damage that they can carry basically any on-field unit if you bring an Anemo support.

![chibi](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fbWRgDbBPBCOlKEvSUnXHiwvN5KFEfuPnSgVnHyME2_845LFhIJaT-JeweFvDkE77D-3k2f45nzx0w4TwirUmXts-VwP5WEXVKPOcheIZ_nfBjKVb73Fnkh-CsOEhUGBMNUMFj-Rgc)
**Kazuha** Is the premier Anemo character for buffs, debuffs, and crowd control. The Elemental DMG bonus on his fourth ascension passive and the ability to keep Elements cycling all contribute greatly to any Elemental DPS’s damage.

With his signature weapon, Freedom Sworn, these buffs stack up. His main drawbacks are his field time and how every team wants him. Kazuha can also [swirl multiple elements in a team.](https://library.keqingmains.com/evidence/combat-mechanics/elemental-effects/transformative-reactions#how-to-get-double-swirls) Be sure to use the “Hold” version of this Skill to do this, as it applies 2U of Anemo instead of 1U. This is what helps apply the ‘double-swirl’.

![chibi](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9f5TMtEbmjHg2rKBuoOzMjAHVVilApbew_r6KRiHJ8Xp-Tr4cK4VItcbPe8GA_fABNzalguMAHK6FMTFKCZMIQEjW4cPDyYSmQz4-6SAMlY7TwI0KscuP8JT5bYnHnqjzFTS1l_oHxc)
**Xiangling** is a 4-star unit who outdamages many 5-star units, often carrying the team from the backline. She is often seen paired with Raiden, Xingqiu, and Bennett, and so will be a natural choice when using Yelan with Raiden.

Her Pyro application is slightly faster than Yoimiya and Diluc, so Yelan might occasionally fail to provide enough Hydro if used without Xingqiu. Without Bennett in the party, Xiangling will struggle to meet energy needs.

![chibi](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/o1DxdmcMdxAccN2crD3uFynBxKdAATcrw5dcBjZGDhcA5x32Cn6vn5NXLNgdognfFqs1MulrMXhf61pNmKZfGw5NK3lyzSvHACeCaaEeEv_aD9nB_ddsZ2npt9iQwLIyJUxkrlMhYWg)
**Fischl**  is the next logical choice of a battery in Electro whenever Raiden is unavailable. By using her Skill to summon Oz, her raven turret, and casting her Burst to reset Oz, she deals constant, respectable Electro damage and generates a steady flow of energy.

Fischl has synergy with many of Yelan’s ideal teammates, making her a stable and flexible choice.

![chibi](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uxSmHZ1Z_oGzGzuq8PPt4ix_DCw2vjMUKPzv54Sb-lDs0CVhblpIH9WTPyvzVavhSiDGE8My-ick6AH0NIa5DnDGQvPRO8XqIEfLD51fLL9w6-q3VmgJEaCAf5d4XowqRR7Eais_CvM)
**Venti** is the best choice for a Viridescent Venerer-holder when your team needs unmatched crowd control.

Some on-field DPS’s prefer everyone to be stuck in one place, and Venti’s Burst can certainly do that while debuffing, allowing Yelan’s Burst waves to hit enemies in the vortex. Raiden, Yoimiya, and Ayato especially benefit from this boon.

Venti also has an energy refund feature that helps energy needs further.

![chibi](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OQSlmk5cAm02l_0tKSl6tXvm3WUqr09Sd6I_jHVC749FIjPXRioa9tiL5KCme3a_-f7NXpYS9KN2Mz8T1zKIRPQeoD4c9zrTlcUQoVvSSuEeFpsueauEudm8osk7_JSXm55XtcQvpf8)
**Zhongli** is the great stabilizer of Genshin Impact, offering a near-indestructible shield and resistance shred. Both of these benefit Yelan and her DPS partner’s damage.

Zhongli will often be used on Hu Tao teams which prefer comfort over the Viridescent debuff from Anemo units.

The 4pc Archaic Petra artifact set also grant 35% damage bonus to his teammates when not opting into 4pc. Tenacity of the Millelith, though 4AP is difficult to use effectively. Due to Yelan having so few available buffs to take advantage of, Archaic Petra is more valuable.

![chibi](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fi4_HXGhg_ecqLD-v9UZq17IIae40K7d5Xboscq8VwFtDqWUnWx-tgC6bbKIM9OkSYKJ2z7miV9jqsDmFA8G2swV0SxOZYz3_BwbfNUKa_z3X3yaQj9mKaXWhGZxfGW0kIU6T4GUlUM)
**Beidou** is most at home when paired with Fischl, an Anemo character, and a hydro applicator. Yelan happens to fit right into this team. She should be used mainly when you expect two or more targets regularly in combat.

Both Beidou and Yelan have Bursts that capitalize on Normal Attacks. This allows them to synergize, as they create Electro-Charged together, and Beidou’s arc lightning bounces between enemies even when Yelan is dealing single-target damage.

![chibi](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZpxEUgSMmepBXw4u9pjgBSFVlLCMW1SSdOZk85qOP-hD7176Mhi7hSXh73MuKUXli4IX-BdzXOeWB-5xP_vUrp8wcNRNoKKgeXQ188QTVBx5LwTcJfEw-WWg4mTCXyl0ymyhcYuoNrE)
**Jean** fulfills two roles on Yelan teams: she offers the Viridescent Venerer debuff, shredding elemental resistances, and she heals.

An additional, undervalued aspect of Jean’s kit is her short Skill cooldown. She’s also commonly seen with a Favonius Sword. Any character that can use their skill twice in a rotation and wield a Favonius weapon will compensate for one battery not doing its job well enough.

![chibi](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5cBD64rkG053K4ch22_g8Tn7mYqegipWmXGH2gaj6n217gtDqffcHUOlIRduarSLCPq1JHRREyo2eZFnxd2h0PJOcgcSusJx1FTExJpDKTt27AKRZjP3eX9IxU4irYDd7BHGclPp5uw)
**Yae Miko** deals heavy damage via her Skill and Burst, and usually wants a battery like Fischl or the Raiden Shogun and an Anemo character. Yelan benefits from both.

It should be noted that Miko has a 22-second cooldown on her Burst, so she is best implemented when your rotation is _already_ going to be 22 seconds, perhaps if Yelan is using her Skill off-cooldown twice per rotation.
