#### Why Should You Play Miko? An Analysis

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/R8ZZ2LByqlJm4A8e3IDn2rWCvZCKmc-3jt-VoGHBzgb1WAxMx6X9nWM1zRZ6cfu6jqXv4ZUKR2_fCEjtcpGi4h6488V5qc0nQyCawDpNSpOfc4_n1eEvOtRXrc3A9ZTQyeoLreUs)

People who enjoy the Elemental Skill turret playstyle of Albedo and Fischl but would also like the stylish, powerful Elemental Burst of a unit like Eula will gain the most satisfaction from playing Miko. Mono-Electro teams featuring Raiden as a DPS also benefit greatly from Miko, since Beidou's Burst doesn't synergize with Raiden's Burst and Raiden renders Fischl's utility as a battery mostly redundant.

In short, Miko is Ei's girlfriend.

#### What is Miko's role in a team?

Miko is an Electro-based SubDPS, requiring lots of stat investment to fully utilize her, but little (necessary) field time compared to other team roles. While levelling a character to 90 is usually good, you could probably get away with levelling Miko to 80, since she is a traditional A/D/C unit (atk%/dmg%/crit%).


When using Miko on your team, she’ll mainly be dealing damage off-field with her skill and on-field with her Burst and, if you choose, attack strings focused on Charged Attacks.

Teams utilizing Miko will primarily be at least one electro battery, a Viridescent Venerer-holder/healer, and a buffer/healer.
The biggest drawback of Miko’s presence on your team is her 22-second Burst cooldown. Longer Burst cooldown means longer rotations, and longer rotations usually means less team DPS. If you plan to use Miko on your team, you should focus on really making every bit of damage in Miko’s kit count to warrant her inclusion.

#### Pros and Cons

#### Benefits

* Capable of dealing strong, consistent Electro damage, with a very high damage burst in every rotation. Basically, she has high multipliers.
* Miko's best four-star weapon options include the non-limited Widsith, which has been in the gacha since the beginning of Genshin Impact. Strong contenders are also either Battle Pass weapons or free, whether it be from the event accompanying her release or crafting.
* Miko offers significant rewards for players who dedicate the necessary resources she needs. Miko scales high with constellations, more than doubling her damage output at C6\.
* Upfront damage on Miko's Burst, requiring only the setting of her turrets, which you'll want to do anyways.
* Her skill has 100% uptime for consistent electro damage.
* The dash from Miko's skill, while it doesn't make her invincible, guarantees her turret will set even when taking damage, unless her HP is reduced to zero.
* Miko's existence enables mono-Electro teams, which previously have suffered from anti-synergy. Beidou and Fischl, for example, work great together but don't pair well with the Raiden Shogun. Miko/Raiden/Sara and Miko/Fischl/Sara are competitive with Hyper Raiden comps and allow Kazuha and Bennett to slot into your second team.
* Miko has fluffy tails.

#### Pros and Cons

#### Drawbacks

* Need high resin investment to get a competitive state; on top of her regular Crit stat needs, Miko also, at c0, non-negotiably requires at least 150% Energy Recharge after a battery is factored into your team, which can be a lot to ask for from artifacts.
* Miko takes up alot of field time (5+ seconds per 22-second rotation) for an off-field DPS. This is especially noteworthy because her best partner, Raiden, also takes lots of field time during her Burst mode. This leaves little room in your rotation for other teammates to do their job, limiting the number of potential teammates.
* Strict team compositions (including benefiting most from Kazuha and Bennett) restrict Miko's flexibility, and hurt your ability to deal with team weaknesses. An electro battery is absolutely required to function at C0\. Mitigating this requirement is locked behind C1 (but at least it's C1 and not more).
* While Raiden is Miko's best partner, it's yet to be seen if Miko is Raiden's best partner. Numbers at time of research do not show a significant damage difference between Raikou teams (Raiden / Miko / Kazuha / Bennett) and Raiden Hyper teams (Raiden / Sara / Kazuha / Bennett)
* Miko's best teammates, Raiden and Fischl, are either five stars or dependent on late constellations to maximize Miko's potential.
* Won't show you her fox form, and will probably mislead you to your doom for fun.

#### Misconceptions

"Miko is good in taser teams"

It depends on what you mean by "taser."  
  
If by "taser," you mean "Beidou-driver," then this claim is false. Beidou-driver comps consist of Fischl as a battery, Beidou as a potent off-field DPS, and XingQiu as an off-field DPS/Support, all of which synergize with a MainDPS's fast auto-attacks. Miko's normal attack strings are below average in both damage and speed.  
  
If by "taser," you mean "any team utilizing the electro-charged reaction," then this claim is false. Miko cannot take Fischl's role due to high energy requirements and inability to battery. I can't, in good faith, recommend a team that requires a constellation or near substat perfect artifacts on Miko to function.  
  
One plausible taser team involves Miko replacing Beidou. The advantage of this is that Miko specializes in single-target scenarios while being batteried by Fischl, while Beidou specializes in multi-target. In a taser team, your Kazuha, Bennett, and Sara (C6) can go to a Raiden Hyper team.

"Miko is 5-star Fischl"

I did describe, in some way, that Miko functions like Fischl, but anything further than that would be to say that "Miko fills the same roles Fischl does." This is false. While I did say Miko just trades battery utility for nuking potential, this is a pretty significant difference in playstyle.  
  
Fischl is a battery, Miko needs a battery. Fischl can spend almost no time on the field to do her job, Miko spends much more time on the field. Fischl's Elemental Skill has more frequent electro application, especially when Fischl is C6, but Miko deals much more damage with her turrets (and overall).

Another important difference is their snapshotting. Fischl's Skill snapshots, and Miko's doesn't. This is a double-edged sword in some cases. Miko can benefit from buffs being applied after she sets her skills (including passives like Memory of Dust), but doesn't synergize well with Bennett because of this, as half of her damage is done off-field (and thus outside of Bennett's circle). Fischl, on the other hand, can make use of snapshotting Bennett's burst.

## Character Overview

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UD4o7swRJkl3dwmeyqFFIzT8Ly7VsGMXhcY65CPybgAD3aTWoag0GHiXFp3u7r_JYuNi55Uxf3X1cKq1a5LwOH5weKxLg50n1fQB1dwclKxtkK-agIj18ZM5yX7BAJpthrolgJtL)

Miko's playstyle is heavily based on:

1. Using all three charges of her Elemental Skill as soon as possible, setting up three kitsune spirit turrets to do her bidding.
2. Swapping out for other party members for buffs to prepare for...
3. Unleashing Miko's nuclear-powered Elemental Burst, consuming the turrets, but resetting their cooldowns.
4. Resetting Miko's turrets, and leaving the rest of your team (and her non-sentient fox turrets) to do her bidding.

Miko is what happens when you upgrade Fischl's stats and trade her utility as a battery for raw burst damage rivaling Eula's, including constellation comparisons. One could just as easily suggest Miko is "Electro Eula," trading normal attacks for powerful turrets and frequent electro application. The comparison to Fischl is based on skill function, while the comparison to Eula is based on raw Burst damage.

At the end of the day, Miko exists to deal damage from the background, make an appearance to drop a few lightning strikes, and retreat back into the shadows. Her frail HP and DEF stats dictate she be played this way, unless you decide to bring a strong shield with you.  
  
In 18s rotations, it is competitive to Burst in every second rotation, given the right build.

### Active Talents

#### Normal Attack: Spiritfox Sineater 
Talent Priority: #3 or N/A  

Normal Attacks perform up to three consecutive strikes. Charged Attacks call down a semi-straight line of six lightning strikes, but only two of them can deal damage: near the beginning and end of the Charged Attack.

Frame Data (Burst Mode)

Recorded in 60 FPS

| Attack Type    | Number of hits/input | Multiplier at T9 | Execution Frame     |
|----------------|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| N1             | 1                    | 64.42%           | 16                  |
| N2             | 1                    | 65.48%           | 33                  |
| N3             | 1                    | 96.71%           | 68/                 |
| Charged Attack | 1-2                  | 242.92%          | 95 (80 w/ J-cancel) |

Frankly speaking, Miko's Normal Attacks are mediocre at best. Her plunging attacks are also nothing special. It is not recommended to invest resources in this talent unless you are truly dedicated to going off-meta and running her as a main DPS.

If you absolutely must level this talent, focus on using her Charged Attacks while maintaining your stamina. Miko's Charged Attacks consume 50 stamina, and in-game offers a limit of five consecutive Charged Attacks if that is where every bit of stamina is going and your Statues of the Seven in Mondstadt and Liyue are 100% leveled. While the maximum stamina one can have is 240, Miko gains some back in-between each Charged Attack.

Jump-cancelling Miko's Charged Attack is essential if you go down this road with Miko, due to frame efficiency. Two hits on Charged Attacks is only possible on large boss enemies like Azhdaha, since the second hit is at the very end of Miko's string of lightning bolts.

Again, it is not recommended to level this talent, and it is not recommended to use her Normal Attacks in taser compositions. Qiqi is more valuable as a driver than Miko.

#### Elemental Skill:Yakan Evocation: Sesshou Sakura

Talent Priority: \#1

Summon a non-sentient fox spirit (her words, not mine) to do your bidding. Miko's skill has three uses/charges, and when these turrets are close together, they each deal more damage. Placing three turrets close together in a triangle formationwill maximize your damage. Summoning them in a straight line will only make two turrets "level 2" and one turret "level 3" (the one connected to the two surrounding turrets) A thin, purple veil will connect these totems as a visual cue.

Miko's skill has no "hold" variation. Only a "tap" version.

| Elemental Gauge  | 1U A Electro on hit |   | 18 Lvl 3 hits | 2,900.88%       |

This skill deals an impressive amount of damage, while also having 100% uptime. This is where the frequent comparisons to Fischl come from. Miko’s turrets are stronger than Fischl’s, but take more time to set and generate much less energy.

In most builds, Miko’s skills deal more damage per rotation than her burst by about 60/40. In a 22-second rotation, one can safely estimate 18 hits from turrets, though more is possible in some cases.


Miko’s low energy production combined with her high energy cost are what require Miko to have an electro battery and sufficient ER investment (~150+%)
