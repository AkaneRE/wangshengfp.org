## Why Should You Play Itto? An Analysis

Itto is a character with many available attack combos, some of which are better in particular circumstances than others. As such, Itto is a character that rewards adaptability, based on the many factors that alter his damage. He is playable for beginners and improves in damage the more skilled you become with his attack strings. He is also the premier 5-star Geo DPS at the time of writing this.

### What is Itto's role in a team?

Itto is a Geo-based hypercarry, requiring the most resources and field time out of any other team role. This means that you should level Itto to 90 (especially due to Itto’s DEF scaling) and raise his talent levels to 9 or 10. In exchange, Itto deals massive damage. Teams utilizing Itto will primarily be off-field supports that take little time on-field to do their job and boost Itto’s effectiveness in some way, either by increasing his damage output or by satisfying his needs to function, such as his ER% requirement to keep Itto's Bursts coming.


Itto’s rotations are focused on ensuring Itto can use his Elemental Burst, which converts his DEF stat into ATK. When in his Burst mode, after factoring in hitlag, you have between 11 and 14 seconds to deal as much damage as possible with his Stacked Charged Attacks (SCA). 

Hypercarries typically are locked into a few specific team comps, making Itto inflexible for team building. You basically always want Albedo, Zhongli, and/or Gorou on any team. Because Itto is of the Geo element, you can’t make use of amplifying elemental reactions with him, making him synergize mainly with other Geo characters. He is heavily dependent on pure multiplier and offensive stats to perform rather than cheating the damage charts with reactions.

One could, in theory, opt into Chongyun or C6 Bennet to try and encourage amplifying elemental reactions with Itto on a Cryo or Pyro goblet, but when in Itto’s Burst mode, his attacks stay as Geo. This would effectively render the most important aspect of Itto’s kit, his Elemental Burst, useless.

### Pros and Cons

#### Benefits

- Capable of dealing strong, consistent Geo damage, with a very high damage burst in every rotation. Basically, he has high multipliers.

- Itto provides both simplicity and depth in his kit, creating a short barrier to entry and room to improve his combos. Specifically, playing Itto well will teach you how to play within tight time frames.

- Geo, like Physical carries can be used in a wider variety of situations, due to having few enemies immune to Geo.

- Cheap and effective weapon alternatives; three of the top 5 weapons for Itto can be acquired either through Battle Pass or are entirely free.

- Surprisingly good AOE and range of attacks while in Burst mode.

- Constellations are not required for Itto to perform at a satisfying level.

- A low-budget battery support for Itto is Geo MC, which every player has.

- High interruption resistance protects your DPS window while in Itto’s Burst mode.

- Itto beatboxes for you on your birthday.

#### Drawbacks

- Needs quite high resin investment (hyper investing) to get a competitive state; Itto must be levelled to 90 and all of his talents need attention.

- Barely functions outside of his Burst; energy requirements must be satisfied.

- You’re basically required to farm 4pc Husk of Opulent Dreams or suffer a 10%+ DPS penalty.

- Strict team compositions restrict Itto’s flexibility, and hurt your ability to deal with team weaknesses.

- If you have C6 Noelle, you’re probably not going to be very motivated to play Itto.

- Itto teams in general will struggle breaking elemental shields.

- Itto’s best teammates, Zhongli and Albedo, are 5-star characters.

- Cannot take advantage of elemental reactions.

- Itto beatboxes for you on your birthday

### C0 Itto vs C6 Noelle

**THIS IS A WIP; WAITING ON TEAM CALCULATOR TO BE FINISHED**

Itto and Noelle have a very similar playstyle: both rely entirely on their Burst to do damage, both infuse their Normal, Charged, and Plunge attacks with Geo, and both scale based off of DEF, adding their DEF to ATK during their Bursts.

The reality is, both are Geo, claymore-wielding Main DPS’s that require a 4pc Husk of Opulent Dreams to reach their maximum potential. They also fight for the same weapons.

For this reason, those who have already hyper-invested into Noelle may not benefit much from rolling for Itto, as you’ll need to level up Itto with lots of EXP and Talent books. This might just be too much work and too much money for a 5-star upgrade.

Please note that a character is only as good as their team comp’s damage, and much more math is to-be-done.
